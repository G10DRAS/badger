A server that serves great lookin' status badges for Travis CI (more support in the future). All of the badges are desinged to fit [GitHub's styling guide and colours](https://github.com/styleguide/css/1.0). I decided to remove the gradient and keep 'em flat. The font is Helvetica, the font that GitHub uses by default. Based on the [Shields](http://badges.github.io/shields/).

## Setup
Just clone this repo to your computer, and `cd` into its folder. Then run `ruby app.rb` (I personally use [`shotgun`](http://rubygems.org/gems/shotgun) but you can use whatever you want) and navigate to [`localhost:4567`](http://localhost:4567/) (or `9393` for `shotgun`). You should see a page telling you that "Sinatra doesnâ€™t know this ditty". That's good. You can now go ahead and navigate to [`localhost:4567/travis/rafalchmiel/sandie.svg`](http://localhost:4567/travis/rafalchmiel/sandie.svg). Of course replace `rafalchmiel` with the owner name, and `sandie` with the repo name. This will serve you a nice SVG status badge based on the `last_build_state` from Travis CI. I'll host this on Heroku soon!
